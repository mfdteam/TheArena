Version 0.2 made by Aasfresser||THIS IS A FREE FOR ALL MAP!!!|| !Please don't take the colour BLACK since its the Ai colour!||Your goal is to get more Points then any other Player in the game. You get Points in three different ways:||1.) Kill other Players! You get Points based on the strength of your Unit compared to the strength of the Unit you killed. (For Example: if a Barbarian kills a Rebel the Barbarian gains 1 Point. If it's the other way around the Rebel gains 9 Points!)||2.) Surviving until the End! The Player that survives until the End gains a additional 5 Points. Second gains 3 Points and Third gains 1 Point.||3.) Capturing the Towers! There are two 'Towers' on the map. Standing on them gains you a Point every 8 Seconds.||Neutral (Black) units spawn at random times! These don't give you any advantage! Infact killing Serfs grants you a 2 Point penalty!||At the 150 Seconds mark of a Round a Barbarian spawns in the very centre of the map, which kills everyone with one hit! Getting killed by the Barbarian also gives you penalty points.
